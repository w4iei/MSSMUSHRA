- content: Instructions for Participants<br><br>Thank you for joining this study at
    the University of Amsterdam.<br><br>This research examines how subjective audio
    quality ratings align with objective measurements in musical source separation
    (MSS)â€”the process of isolating instruments (e.g., guitar, vocals, drums, bass)
    from a mix.<br><br><b>Task Overview</b><br>- You will complete <b>40 tasks</b>
    (~30 minutes).<br>- Each task involves rating an isolated instrument track on
    a scale from <b>0 to 100</b>:<br>  - <b>100</b> = Perfect match to the reference<br>  -
    <b>0</b> = Unintelligible or complete failure<br><br><b>What to Listen For</b><br>-
    Unwanted sounds (e.g., other instruments leaking in)<br>- Distortions or artifacts<br>-
    Clarity and naturalness<br><br><b>Test Setup</b><br>- Use a <b>computer</b> with
    <b>headphones</b>.<br>- Find a <b>quiet</b> space.<br><br>Thank you!<br><b>Noah
    Jaffe</b>
