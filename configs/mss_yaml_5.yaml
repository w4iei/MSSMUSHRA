- content: "Thank you for taking part in this study as the part at the University\
    \ of Amsterdam.<br>In this research, we will be performing an informal MUSHRA\
    \ experiment to correlate subjective score of audio quality with objective measures.\
    \ In musical source separation (MSS), an audio recording is broken into its constituent\
    \ parts (eg guitar, singing, drums, bass). These extractions can have varying\
    \ qualities as measured objectively and subjectively\u2014at odds with similar\
    \ extractions. In other words, some extractions can have a high objective score\
    \ and sound terrible, but others can have the opposite.<br>In this experiment,\
    \ you will hear approximately 25 different audio samples. The samples are of individual\
    \ instruments (eg. guitar, drums, bass, or vocals). A reference (perfect 100 score)\
    \ will be provided. In this test, please rate the other recordings from 0 (unintelligible,\
    \ or complete task failure) to 100. The task should take approximately 15 minutes.<br><br><br>Please\
    \ use your computer at a reasonable volume with headphones in a quiet listening\
    \ environment.<br>When evaluating these extracts, compare them to the reference,\
    \ which would warrant a 100% score. <br> Pay particular attention to whether the\
    \ extract has other instruments that should not be present, interference, or noise.\
    \ These should negatively affect the score. <br>Thanks, Noah Jaffe"
