- content: Thank you for taking part in this study as the part at the University of
    Amsterdam.<br>In this research, we will be performing an informal MUSHRA experiment
    to correlate subjective score of audio quality with objective measures. In musical
    source separation (MSS), an audio recording is broken into its constituent parts
    (eg guitar, singing, drums, bass). These extractions can have varying qualities
    as measured objectively and subjectively at odds with similar estimates. In other
    words, some extractions can have a high objective score and sound terrible, but
    others can have the opposite.<br>In this experiment, you will hear approximately
    25 different audio samples. The samples are of individual instruments (eg. guitar,
    drums, bass, or vocals). A reference (perfect 100 score) will be provided. In
    this test, please rate the other recordings from 0 (unintelligible, or complete
    task failure) to 100. The task should take approximately 15 minutes.<br>Please
    use your computer at a reasonable volume with headphones in a quiet listening
    environment.<br>When evaluating these extracts, compare them to the reference,
    which would warrant a 100% score. <br> Pay particular attention to whether the
    extract has other instruments that should not be present, interference, or noise.
    These should negatively affect the score.<br>Thanks, Noah Jaffe
